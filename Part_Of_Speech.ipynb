But the entire journey that we had from day one till the last day of the tournament was itself a memory for us, something that we can always cherish. We worked really, really hard for that trophy. And from day one, since the day we arrived in the US and the day we left Barbados, everything was memorable for us. It was a wonderful experience. Look, something that I never expected so early in my career, to be an ICC ambassador. You know, it’s a big honour. Holding the trophy back again and putting it back in play feels great. Lifting the trophy was a wonderful feeling, but again, to put it back into play and look at these boys going and working hard for that trophy again will be an interesting thing, which I’m pretty sure everyone’s looking forward to. We want to see some really good cricket being played in this tournament, which is what ICC brings. It brings the best of cricket on display. Every team who are playing, they bring the best cricket out there, and it’ll be entertaining for all the spectators to watch. '''"
